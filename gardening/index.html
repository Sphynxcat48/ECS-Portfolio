        <p> Walking onions are very easy to grow and if grown right can add a nice flavor to your dishes. They are very hardy and overwinter on their own. They also produce bulbils(see image above) in late summer and into fall and plnying them is an easy way to exapand your onion patch. These onions are good for traditional green oinion use and noemal onion use, because of this these plants have a wide varity of applications.   </p>
